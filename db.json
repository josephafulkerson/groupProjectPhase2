It’s a real family, with weights! Come down and make friends with the staff. When you're ready to get your personal training on I am here to help. Not only will I help you hit your personal records. I will take pity on your personal shortcomings. We are going to train your body and your mind, for that thing your parents did. So come on down to S&J, cause you need help!"

After I served 10, I got out and wanted to change my life. Now I'm here at S&J making sure that you stay off the streets and you get in the gym. My workouts are prison court-yard style. That’s tough! We are using dumbbells, pull up bars, and good old cement to get through my workouts. When we are done, as a reward, it’s a pack of ramen-noodles for your post work out meal. Shrimp Flavor. See you in the gym!"

Come on down to S&J and if you live through pain. If you make it congratulations you get to do it again tomorrow."
