After I served 10, I got out and wanted to change my life. Now I'm here at S&J making sure that you stay off the streets and you get in the gym. My workouts are prison court-yard style. That’s tough! We are using dumbbells, pull up bars, and good old cement to get through my workouts. When we are done, as a reward, it’s a pack of ramen-noodles for your post work out meal. Shrimp Flavor. See you in the gym!"
