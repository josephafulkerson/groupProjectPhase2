What can I say about S&J? How can one sum of a terrible experience without going to therapy first? The facility 1/5. The staff 1/5. The equipment 2/5. I think I will go back to situps while laying on my couch. 


I really like S&J. It reminds me of why I hate the world. It's a great sense of motivation. My wrist are sprained from pushups on concrete. There was no ice to help heal and I think I heard bears. 

Cool people, but I would only reccomend if you are dead broke. 

One Word, BATHROOM. 

 I had to walk around with my tazer. The owner said "Think of it as a wrist workout".

I am having a converstaion with my lawyer.
